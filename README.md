# Autonomous-Route-following-system-for-small-degree-routes
In real world, we have a lot of straight highways. In this highways, we do not need to make an movement to drive. We can just start our cruise control and lock our cars' wheel. Do you think that it is simple?. Actually there is not any highways, which is 100 percent straight. Because of this situation we can not lock our the wheel of our autos and can not go straight.To lock our wheel and watch the route, we can design a controller and our system can follow our routes autonomusly for small degree. For example our system can follow small sinus signal. You can see our system.We assumed that it is unicycle robot. We are going to adjust our robots' angle via controlling angular accelartion
